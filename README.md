# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
## Project Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store looking to gain deeper insights into its customers' shopping habits. This project analyzes their data to uncover patterns in when and how people shop, helping to answer key questions that can inform Instacart's marketing and sales strategies. 
## Objectives
Use Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib to answer some key business questions, such as:
  - What are the busiest days of the week? Busiest hours of the day?
  - Are there particular times when people spend the most money?
  - Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of orders?
  - How many of our users are loyal?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status? based on their region?
## Data Source
This project uses open-source Instacart data, inlcuding customer info, order history, and product & department details. I worked on Jupyter notebooks to clean, merge and analyze the data.
